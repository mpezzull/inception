This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different
services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You
have to use docker-compose.

## Mandatory part

Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service.
Each service has to run in a dedicated container:
  You then have to set up:
  - A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
  - A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.
  - A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
  - A volume that contains your WordPress database.
  - A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
  - A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
  - Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.

Here is an example diagram of the expected result:
